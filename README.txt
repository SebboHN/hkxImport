For the script to work make sure you have all the necessary prerequisite:

- Havok Content Tools 
- Havok 3ds Max Plugin (https://github.com/PredatorCZ/HavokMax/releases) 
- NIF_Exporter (for 3ds Max 2013 provided by Beth in \Fallout 4\Tools\NIF_Exporter folder. (For newer 3ds Max versions search on nexusmods) 

Installation: 
- Close 3ds Max
- Use the 3dsMaxPlugin files included or download the latest release. ( https://github.com/PredatorCZ/HavokMax/releases )
- Copy the file for your 3dsMax version into the following folder: InstallPath\Autodesk\3ds Max 20xx\plugins
- Copy the hkxreano.exe into the same folder as your script file. It always has to be in the same folder. If you create a button in 3dsMax for 
  this script, be aware that you have to place the .exe into that MaxFolder he uses.
  (e.g. C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\2013 - 64bit\ENU\usermacros\)
